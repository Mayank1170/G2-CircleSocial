## 1. Introduction

The Circle project aims to revolutionize the social media landscape by creating a decentralized social media platform that empowers users, prioritizes their privacy and data ownership, and upholds the fundamental principle of freedom of speech. We envision a platform that fosters strong communities, encourages meaningful connections, and provides a censorship-resistant environment for users to freely express themselves.

By leveraging decentralized technologies such as blockchain and peer-to-peer networks, Circle ensures that no single authority can control or manipulate the flow of information. We prioritize user privacy, providing individuals with full ownership and control over their data and the ability to choose the level of privacy they desire. Circle's commitment to privacy extends beyond the platform itself; we pledge to never exploit user data for targeted advertising or surveillance purposes.

## 2. Vision Statement

Circle's vision is to become the leading decentralized social media platform that empowers individuals, respects their privacy, and facilitates genuine interactions and content sharing. We strive to create a vibrant and inclusive community-driven ecosystem where users have full control over their data, connections, and experiences.

## 3. Objectives

- Build a decentralized social media platform that ensures user privacy, prevents censorship, and allows users to own and control their data.
- Foster strong and diverse communities by enabling users to connect with others who share their interests and values.
- Enhance user experience by offering innovative features that promote meaningful interactions and content discovery.
- Establish a scalable infrastructure that can accommodate a growing user base without compromising performance and usability.
- Promote open standards and interoperability to connect with other decentralized platforms and create a more inclusive social media ecosystem.

## 4. Background Survey

- Before embarking on the Circle project, a thorough background survey was conducted to understand the existing social media landscape, user preferences, and pain points associated with centralized platforms. The survey included interviews with potential users, market research, and analysis of user feedback from existing platforms. The insights gained from the survey were instrumental in shaping the vision and feature set of Circle.
- In an era where centralized social media platforms have faced criticism for their lack of privacy, censorship, and data exploitation, Circle stands as a beacon of change. We firmly believe that every individual has the right to express their opinions and ideas without fear of retribution or censorship. Circle embraces the principles of freedom of speech, allowing users to openly share their thoughts, engage in constructive discussions, and challenge established norms.
